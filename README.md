# Nexus Android App
Nexus is an open-sourced web based chat application that you can find here: [https://github.com/noerrorstudio/nexus](https://github.com/noerrorstudio/nexus). \
We have created a desktop client and android client too for this web app to make communication easier and faster, without the use of your browser.
